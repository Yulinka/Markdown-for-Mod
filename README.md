Wendolyn was created as the other half of my June 2017 birthday gift to my partner [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010524937]![steam icon](http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/avatars/90/90c691376873c50ce628a43a2eec2a5331d41110_full.jpg “Keidence“)[/url]. :heart:
Wendolyn represents my pet obsessed, slightly insane/oddball characteristics wrapped up into a creepy-cute girl.
All assets, artwork, sound files were made by me.
All programming and mechanics were made by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010524937]Keidence[/url].
